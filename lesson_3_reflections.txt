When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Yeah

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks to clone a repository from github to github, clones can be done from github to local and branches only local
